# Cleaning scripts

This directory contains all the scripts that have been used to clean and
normalise data prior to the development of the data story.

For more information about how this is used in practise, feel free to read the
[Dataset and preprocessing](https://p-adema.github.io/info-vis/docs/dataset-preprocessing.html) section.
