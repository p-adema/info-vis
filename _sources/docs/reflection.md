# Reflection

## Peer feedback

On June 22th, 2023, our team J3 gathered with group R3 and R4 for peer feedback,
where one group at a time pitched the work that has been done in the past 3
weeks. After the pitch, the two other groups gave feedback on what has been done
well, as well as things to improve on.

The main compliments we received for the version we had at time was that our
data story looked really well along with the fact that we hide our all
codeblocks inside the story, which gives it the clean look it still has today.

Below is a list of the feedback provided from group R3 and R4, as well as the TAs:
- Have a look at maturnity leave for women and see if that could be a reason why women are getting less paid than men
- All graphs should have captions, as some of them still don't have one
- Add a regression line for the "Gender Ratio of Position vs Pay Gap" graph
- Add missing dataset-preprocessing, reflection, and work-distribution pages in the notebook

Later on we as a team agreed all of this was proper feedback to work one. Right
after the day of feedback we have implemented all of the above feedback.

## Self-reflection

If this project had lasted an additional week or two, the main idea we would
seek to implement would be to create a unified model of salary based on the
factors we analysed. Currently, every factor is analysed independently of the
others. As such, any differences in compensation noted in the graph of one
factor could result from the other three elements. To better understand how much
of the pay gap results from discrimination, it would be best to combine the
influences of every factor (adjusting expected salary not only on age or work
experience but all four aspects simultaneously). This method can also be seen in
many scientific articles (such as Boll & Lagemann, 2018) but is somewhat
time-consuming. As such, we did not use it for this data story, but we would
have liked to do so, given the opportunity.
