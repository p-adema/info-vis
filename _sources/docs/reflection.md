# Reflection

## Peer feedback

On June 22th, 2023, our team J3 gathered with group R3 and R4 for peer feedback,
where one group at a time pitched the work that has been done in the past 3
weeks. After the pitch, the two other groups gave feedback on what has been done
well, as well as things to improve on.

The main compliments we received for the version we had at time was that our
data story looked really well along with the fact that we hide our all
codeblocks inside the story, which gives it the clean look it still has today.

Below is a list of the feedback provided from group R3 and R4, as well as the TAs:
- Have a look at maturnity leave for women and see if that could be a reason why women are getting less paid than men
- All graphs should have captions, as some of them still don't have one
- Add a regression line for the "Gender Ratio of Position vs Pay Gap" graph
- Add missing dataset-preprocessing, reflection, and work-distribution pages in the notebook

Later on we as a team agreed all of this was proper feedback to work one. Right
after the day of feedback we have implemented all of the above feedback.

## Self-reflection

If this project had lasted an additional week or two,
the main idea we would seek to implement would be to
create a unified model of salary based on the factors
we analysed. Currently, every factor is analysed
independently of the others. As such, any differences
in compensation noted in the graph of one factor could
result from the other three elements. To better understand
how much of the pay gap results from discrimination, it would
be best to combine the influences of every factor (adjusting
expected salary not only on age or work experience but all
four aspects simultaneously). This method can also be seen in
many scientific articles (such as Boll & Lagemann, 2018) but
is somewhat time-consuming. As such, we did not use it for this
data story, but we would have liked to do so, given the opportunity.
