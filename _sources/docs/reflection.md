## Peerfeedbacl

On Thursday, June 22th 2023, our team J3 gathered with group R3 and R4 for
peerfeedback, where one group at a time pitched the work that has been done in
the past 3 weeks. After the pitch, the two other groups gave feedback on what
has been done well, as well as things to improve on.

The main compliments we received for the version we had at time was that our
data story looked really well along with the fact that we hide our all
codeblocks inside the story, which gives it the clean look it still has today.

Below is a list of feedback combined from group R3 and R4 along with the
feedback from the TAs:
- Have a look at maturnity leave for women and see if that could be a reason why women are getting less paid than men.
- All graphs should have captions, as some of them still don't have one.
- Add a regression line for the "Gender Ratio of Position vs Pay Gap" graph
- Add missing dataset-preprocessing, reflection, and work-distribution pages in the notebook.

Later on we as a team agreed all of this was proper feedback to work one. Right
after the day of feedback we have implemented all of the above feedback.
