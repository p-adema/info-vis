# Introduction

For more than two centuries women have been fighting for equal rights and equal treatment. It has become more and more a political issue.
In many Western societies equal rights for men and women are laid down in law.
This does not mean that men and women are treated equally, but in many countries gender discrimination is against the law.
A notorious difference between men and women is their salaries, how much they get paid for the same amount and quality of work.

This text will explore salaries of software developers, based on data from Stack Overflow (SO), an online community of software developers.
SO runs a yearly survey, asking its members questions about their age, skills, work, interests.
Data from these surveys are available and can be used to analyse the working conditions for these developers.

In particular, we will explore the correlation between yearly salary and features like age, country and job type.
